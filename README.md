# Albula

A minimalistic self-hosted music server.

## Current status

It ain't much, but it works!

## Why not Plex / Subsonic / Airsonic / ...?

I just made Albula for myself because I disliked several things about the other options. Most likely, it will not be better than them for you - unless you just happen to care about proper support for multiple artists or a less crowded interface.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Pip packages specified in `requirements.txt`
